Quantum Superposition &amp; Entanglement, Both Simulated and on real IBMQ Quantum Computer

Use IBM QISkit (Quantum Information Science kit) in Python to show quantum superposition (with Hadamard gate)
and quantum entanglement (bell state, with Hadamard & CNOT gate).
The quantum circuit is processed both by IBM quantum simulator and IBM real quantum computer (IBMQ)
