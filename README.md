A 1 Qubit Quantum Superposition & 2 Qubits Quantum Entanglement with IBM QISkit

Use IBM QISkit (Quantum Information Science kit) in Python to show quantum superposition (with Hadamard gate)
and quantum entanglement (bell state, with Hadamard & CNOT gate).
The constructed quantum circuit is processed both by IBM quantum simulator and IBM real quantum computer (IBMQ).
